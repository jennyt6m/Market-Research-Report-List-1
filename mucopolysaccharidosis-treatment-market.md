<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mucopolysaccharidosis Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular (ICV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) treatment market is primarily classified into two types: intravenous and intracerebroventricular (ICV) treatments. Intravenous administration involves delivering therapeutic enzymes directly into the bloodstream, facilitating systemic distribution and targeting of affected tissues. In contrast, ICV treatment involves injecting medication directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, allowing for targeted delivery to the central nervous system. Both methods aim to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life for MPS patients, but they cater to different therapeutic needs based on disease severity and type.</p></p>
